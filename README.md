# AniManager
AniManager is an iOS application that lets the user track and explore anime and manga. It's the final project of the Udacity iOS Nanodegree which should be an own app. It uses the [AniList](https://anilist.co) API to get anime and manga data and also enables the user to track progress with anime and manga if the user has an AniList account.
